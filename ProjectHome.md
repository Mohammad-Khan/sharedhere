# Welcome to SharedHere #

SharedHere is an open source geotagged content sharing system where content is mapped to specific gps coordinates. Users walking within close proximity of a location will be given an opportunity to interact with the content in various ways.

Possible usage scenarios include writing a review of a restaurant and store it at the GPS coordinates right outside the restaurant for future guests to read, new advertising opportunities for businesses and individuals alike, games such as virtual scavenger hunts or simply just leave a digital "I was here"-mark in the world. The possibilities and usages are numerous!
